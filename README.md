## React Deployment Notes
- `Create-React-App` has a command that builds out a react app
  - When we build our app it creates a deployment bundle.
    - In this deployment bundle are a couple of files required to run our project.
    - Static files - normal files that can exist inside of some folder or directory.
    - Files include:
      - `index.html`
      - `bundle.js`
      - `image.jpg`
      - `index.css` 
    - Those static files will be uploaded to some `Deployment Target`(Server or service provider where the files will be hosted)
