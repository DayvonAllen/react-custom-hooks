## React Deployment Notes
- `Create-React-App` has a command that builds out a react app
  - When we build our app it creates a deployment bundle.
    - In this deployment bundle are a couple of files required to run our project.
    - Static files - normal files that can exist inside of some folder or directory.
    - Files include:
      - `index.html`
      - `bundle.js`
      - `image.jpg`
      - `index.css` 
    - Those static files will be uploaded to some `Deployment Target`(service provider where the files will be hosted)
    - Whenever a user types in our URL or domain, they are always going to get a response with the `index.html`.
      - Inside of that `index.html` files will be a variety of script and link tags that causes the browser to make additional requests to get additional JS or CSS files.
    - When deploying a react app we don't need a full VM, as we are not executing any code.
    - You only need a full virtual machine when you are running some kind of active server(eg. Node JS API, Spring API, Go API), it necessary for servers that are actively run some code.
    - It costs dramatically less to deploy a react app compared to an API because it just requires a place to host static files.
